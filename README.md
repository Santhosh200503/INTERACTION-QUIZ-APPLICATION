##The Interactive Quiz Application is a simple yet effective web-based project designed to test users' knowledge through multiple-choice questions. Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic and interactivity, the application offers a smooth and responsive user experience. The quiz presents one question at a time, and users select their answer by clicking on one of the multiple options provided. Once an answer is chosen, the application immediately provides instant feedback by highlighting the correct answer in green and incorrect ones in red. This not only helps users learn on the spot but also keeps them engaged throughout the quiz. A "Next" button allows users to move forward through the quiz, and once all questions have been answered, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions. Additionally, a restart option is provided so users can take the quiz again. The questions are stored as a JavaScript array of objects, making the quiz fully dynamic and easy to updateâ€”developers can add, edit, or remove questions without changing the core logic. The app has a clean, mobile-friendly design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. This project showcases essential programming skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, array operations, and UI feedback, making it a great learning tool for beginners and a solid base for more advanced quiz systems in the future. Possible extensions could include a countdown timer, difficulty levels, score storage, or database integration for real-time quizzes.
